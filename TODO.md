# TODO

- Make `RowRange` and `ColumnRange` @safe now that they store parenting Sheet by Value

- Merge `SparseCell.location` and `SparseCell.position` into one single field

- Ask Ilya if and how we should use mir.string_map. As element type for instance
  in `Table.withHeaders(headers).rows`

- Use STAX XML parser via calls to parseXML instead of decodeXML

- Remove commented out D code

- Clean up `readSharedEntries`

- Replace row.attributes.filter!(a => a.name == "r").front with row.attributeNamed("r")

- Make `readCells` safe

- Cache parts or whole calculation of `dom` in `readCells`

- In `readCells()`, can we reserve `ret` by looking up dimensions
  somewhere in DOM. Print string passed to DOM and look into it.

- In `readSharedEntries()`, can we reserve `ret` by looking up dimensions
  somewhere in DOM. Print string passed to DOM and look into it.

- Replace calls to array append `~=` with `Appender.put()` taking a range if possible

- Clean up `readCells`

- Clean up `insertValueIntoCell`

- Avoid cast to `immutable` in `convertToString` and return `inout(ubyte)` instead

- Call `assumeUnique` at the end of `readCells` if `Cell.members` are
  `immutable`.

- TODO: 1. contruct this lazily in Sheet upon use and cache

- TODO: 2. deprecate it

- const Relationships* sheetRel = rid in rels; // TODO: move this calculation to caller and pass Relationships as rels

- Replace ret ~= tORr.children[0].text.specialCharacterReplacementReverseLazy.to!string; with
  ret.put(tORr.children[0].text.specialCharacterReplacementReverseLazy)

- Make sure all the calls `expandTrusted`, `convertToString`, `parseDOM` are
  only called once (and cached) for every ArchiveMember by moving them into
  caching members of `File`.

- Move body of `parseRelationships` into `File.parseRelationships` and make the
  module-scope public `parseRelationships` a thin wrapper on top of it. Cache
  the calculation of `parseRelationships` in an AA mapping from `ArchiveMember`
  to `RelationshipsById` if needed and store that AA in private `File` member.

- Clean up `parseRelationships`

- Replace `assert(dom.children.length == 1);` with `enforce(dom.children.length == 1);`
  and similarly for other asserts.

- Qualify some functions in std.zip as pure and then qualify D code in this
  package as pure.  Qualify `std.zip.ZipArchive` members as, at least, `pure`
  and then the functions in there that use them.

- Make sure Sheet.cells is in the same data layout as SILâ€™s Matrix datatype
  added in version 2.48.
